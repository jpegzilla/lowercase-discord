***

a bot to help my fellow lowercase evangelists. let's bring lowercase harmony to the world one discord server at a time.

### prefix:
`l~`

### function:
evaluates user messages, replaces all uppercase letters that are not the personal pronoun 'I' with their lowercase equivalent, deletes the offending message, and sends the correct message.

### usage:

invite the bot here:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=631079115243388938&scope=bot&permissions=268790902

if you want to run this yourself, basically just create a .env file in the directory root with your discord token `TOKEN=your-token-here` &mdash; or, put it in your environment variables. that's all! simply `npm start` and you're ready to go.
